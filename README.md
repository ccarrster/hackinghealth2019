Deployed basic prototype

Data fake

"Together"

Run database.sql in mysql to create database and tables
Open edit.php
Modify the database connection password to your own.
Browse to edit.php and you can create and remove Events, Organizations, Locations and Resources.
Plan is to have a Relationship as well where you can link two things. Maybe two events(Date Time get together) are relaited. Maybe an organization(Group) is hosting an event. Maybe an event is at a location(Address). Maybe that location has a resource(kitchen, diabled washroom)
